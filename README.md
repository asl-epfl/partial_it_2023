Fig. 4 is generated executing file 'fig_4.py'.

Figs. 6 and 7 are generated executing file 'figs_6_7.py'.

Figs. 8 and 9 are generated executing file 'figs_8_9.py'.

Fig. 10 is generated executing file 'fig_10.py'.

Please note that the code is not generally perfected for performance, but is rather meant to illustrate certain results from the paper. The code is provided as-is without guarantees.
